 Hi there ! 👋
-------
Welcome to my GitHub. My name is Amol and I'm a Machine Learning Developer at Global AI Solutions working on Speech Processing 🗣, Object Detection , on [Hello Shraa](https://helloshraa.com/), a project that leverages Speech Recognition to analyse and improve the pronunciation of user.


Outside of Machine Learning, my interests are:
- Sports 🚴‍♂️: Playing Volleyball is my most favourite one as a matter of fact i also used to represent the district level team. 
- Reading/Learning 💻: I spend most of my free time trying to learn stuffs. I try to do 1 online course per month, although I don't always manage to do so.


I have a B.E. in Computer Engineering  from the University of Pune. It would be unfair to say my undergrad degree gave me the passion behind starting ML but in some fair point it help me to understand the math behind it. 

My technical interests are:
- Applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- Statistics in general
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Processing
- A bit of data engineering, since I'd like my next professional experience to be as a Machine Learning Engineering

Data Science is moving fast. Reading about AI-related news could be a full-time job. I learn best by doing projects. So I post most of them here.



You can [contact me](mailto:amol.jagdambe@gmail.com) if you think we could work together on  a project, or if you have any question/remark. If you would like to get to know more about me and my projects.
